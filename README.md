**🏙️ Smart City Automated Complaint Management System**

**📌 Project Description**

The Smart City Automated Complaint Management System is a web-based application designed to improve the efficiency of handling citizen complaints in urban environments. Smart cities aim to enhance quality of life by using digital technologies, but traditional complaint management systems rely heavily on manual categorization and routing, leading to delays and inefficiencies.
This project addresses these issues by using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify citizen complaints and route them to the appropriate municipal department. Citizens can submit complaints related to essential services such as roads, water supply, electricity, garbage management, and public safety. The system analyzes the complaint text and predicts the correct category, reducing human intervention and improving response time.
A special focus is given to public safety and women safety, allowing emergency-related complaints and providing quick access to important authority contact details.
